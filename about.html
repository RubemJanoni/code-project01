                <strong>Yoga</strong> is an ancient science that is over <strong>5000 years old</strong> and aims to unite body, mind and spirit, allowing people to reconnect with their true essence.
                <p>According to spiritual master <strong>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</strong>, “Yoga gives you the power to feel the way you want to feel, at any time, without being a victim of your own feelings. Yoga makes you an independent person”.</p>This greater awareness and control over the mind and emotions is something desired by all types of people. Therefore, nothing is more indispensable these days than the practice of yoga.
                There are different types of yoga practices, but traditionally there are also different paths in yoga.<br>They all lead to the same goal: to achieve union and integration of the body with the mind. These different paths come together to bring benefits in the most complete way that this philosophy can offer.<br>
            </p>
